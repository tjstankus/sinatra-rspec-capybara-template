Sinatra/RSpec/Capybara Template
===============================

A minimal modular Sinatra app using RSpec and Capybara for testing. The app
includes a root path route and a feature spec for that route. And that's pretty
much it.

##  Setup

````bundle install````
##  Test

Run the spec with ````bundle exec rspec````.

You should get the following output.

    Home
      responds with successful status
    
      Finished in 0.01443 seconds
      1 example, 0 failures
